//! The *term* module defines typed[`Term`]sof the form `fn_add(x: u8, fn_square(y: u16)) â†’ u16`.
//! Each function like `fn_add` or `fn_square` has a shape. The variables `x` and `y` each have a
//! type. These types allow type checks during the runtime of the fuzzer.
//! These checks restrict how[`Term`]scan be mutated in the *fuzzer* module.
